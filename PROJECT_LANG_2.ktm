// Project langugae file 2
// For: Linux Defender for ReplicantOS
// About:
// I decided to make Kotlin the 1st project language file for this project (Linux Defender for ReplicantOS) as this software port is for a system based on Android, and the native language to Android is Java, but also Kotlin. Alternative functionality is available in Java, SCSS, Assembly, C++, and possibly another language will also be supported if needed.
