// About:
// I decided to make Java the 1st project language file for this project (Linux_Defender_for_ReplicantOS) as this software port is for ReplicantOS, which is based heavily on Android, and the native language to Android is Java. Alternative functionality will also be available in SCSS, Assembly, C, and possibly another language if needed.
